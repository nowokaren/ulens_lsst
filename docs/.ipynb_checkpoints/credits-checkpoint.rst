The `ulens_lsst` package was developed by Karen Nowogrodzki, with significant contributions from:

- Anibal Varela: Original author of the `ulens_utils` module, which provides utility functions for microlensing simulations. The module was adapted and optimized by Karen Nowogrodzki for integration with the `ulens_lsst` pipeline, ensuring compatibility with LSST data processing workflows.

We thank the LSST community for providing the data and tools that make this project possible.
